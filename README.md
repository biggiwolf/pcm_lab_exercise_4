PCM 2016-2017 Fourth Processing Exercise (Video Segmentation) Using the provided video (PCMLab10.mov), do the following (by directly accessing individual pixel values and not by using predefined filters or specialised libraries): 
1. Perform stroboscopic segmentation. Save the first frame of each video segment as an image file and create a text file where you display the time index of each segment's first frame. [100 XP] 
2. Implement transition detection with a parameterisable threshold. To do so, compute histograms and use differences between consecutive frames' histograms (histogram differences or squared histogram differences). Again, save the first frame of each video segment as an image file and create a text file where you display the time index of each segment's first frame. [100 XP] 
3. Repeat point 2, but using twin-comparison. Check the handouts in the materials for a quick reference on twin-comparison. [100 XP] 
4. Save a text file that lists the histogram differences between consecutive frames of the video and register the thresholds used for transitions detection. [100 XP] The file should present the list with four columns like this: Frame		Histogram_Diff		Threshold1	Threshold2 (â€¦) 
5. Detect transitions using the methods implemented in 2 and 3. Create algorithms to compute suitable thresholds. Think, explore, create and innovate! [200 XP]
